# tools (WIP)

this is kitchen-sink for tools that i use and external applications for, and was never satisfied with them,
so ill just make them myself how i like them, and improve upon them gradually.

making this open source in case anyone, wants to host their own stuff.

check `Dockerfile` for dependencies.

## modules

- password manager
- notes
- todo lists
- rss reader

### credentials.env file for docker-compose
```
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=
```

might need to run db:create on the docker, not sure.

### additional info:
code is hosted on <http://tools.ozkar.org> and the docker repo is <https://hub.docker.com/r/ozkar99/tools/>

send me an email or something if you want an account since registrations are currently closed.
