# tools (WIP)

this is kitchen-sink for tools that i use and external applications for, and was never satisfied with them,
so ill just make them myself how i like them, and improve upon them gradually.

making this open source in case anyone, wants to host their own stuff.

check `Dockerfile` for dependencies.

## modules

- password manager
- notes
- todo
- rss reader

## where
tools.ozkar.org, if you want an account hit me up, as registration is disabled for now.

### credentials.env file for docker-compose
```
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=
```

might need to run db:create on the docker, not sure.
