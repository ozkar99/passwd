# tools

this is kitchen-sink for tools that i use and external applications for, and was never satisfied with them,
so ill just make them myself how i like them, and improve upon them gradually.

making this open source in case anyone, wants to host their own stuff.

check `Dockerfile` for dependencies.

## passwd

its just a collection of: name, login, password  and its crud application.
nothing fancy.

## todo

kinder-garden developer excercize, i just use a vim for this usually, might as well have something centralized

## notes

evernote interface is not that good IMO, so this is also a replacement for that.
